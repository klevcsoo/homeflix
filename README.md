A simple Plex-like media server running on my Raspberry PI 4.

*Not that it's so great or something, it was more like an experiment.*

It can't really be used for much, because of the stuff specific to my setup, but I made this public anyway for no reason really.
**This is archived, because my PI is now being used for other purposes.**

*But I might just come back to it in the futureðŸ¤”*
